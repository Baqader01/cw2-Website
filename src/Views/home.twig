      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p><strong>The Community Table</strong> was established in 2018 by local organiser <strong>Maya Patel</strong> and chef <strong>David Green</strong> as a neighbourhood initiative to tackle food insecurity and social isolation in the heart of East London. What began as a small food bank and soup kitchen in a church hall has evolved into a vibrant community hub where people cook, share, and learn together.</p>
      <p>Today, The Community Table runs a zero-waste café, weekly community meals, and cooking workshops that celebrate seasonal, affordable, and culturally diverse food. All proceeds go back into supporting local families through meal donations, skills training, and volunteer opportunities.</p>
      <p>Recognised for its innovative approach to social sustainability, The Community Table received the <em>London Food Roots Award (2023)</em> and continues to partner with local growers and surplus suppliers to ensure that no good food goes to waste.</p>
